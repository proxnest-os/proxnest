## 🔧 How to Install Apps

### Individual Apps
1. Go to **Dashboard → App Store**
2. Browse or search for an app
3. Click **Install**
4. Wait for the installation to complete (usually 1-3 minutes)
5. Click **Open** to access the app's web UI

### Stacks
1. Go to **Dashboard → App Store → Stacks**
2. Select a stack (e.g., "Media Server")
3. Click **Install Stack**
4. All apps in the stack install sequentially with auto-wiring

### Via CLI
```bash
proxnest app install jellyfin
proxnest stack install media-server
```

---

## 🔗 How Auto-Wiring Works

When you install apps that work together, ProxNest automatically configures the connections:

- **Radarr** → automatically connects to qBittorrent (download client) and Prowlarr (indexers)
- **Sonarr** → same auto-connections as Radarr
- **Prowlarr** → automatically syncs indexers to Radarr, Sonarr, and Lidarr
- **Bazarr** → automatically connects to Radarr and Sonarr for subtitle management
- **Jellyfin** → automatically maps media directories shared with Radarr/Sonarr

All apps share a common directory structure:
```
/data/media/movies    → Movies (Radarr → Jellyfin)
/data/media/tv        → TV Shows (Sonarr → Jellyfin)
/data/media/music     → Music (Lidarr → Navidrome)
/data/downloads       → Download client output
```

No YAML editing. No port conflicts. No manual configuration files.
