# Getting Started with ProxNest

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install
1. Download the ProxNest ISO from [proxnest.com](https://proxnest.com)
2. Flash it to a USB drive using [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)
3. Boot your server from the USB drive
4. Follow the Proxmox installer (takes ~3 minutes)
5. Server reboots → ProxNest agent installs automatically

### Step 2: Connect to Cloud
1. Go to [cloud.proxnest.com](https://cloud.proxnest.com) and create an account
2. Your server appears automatically — click **Claim** and enter the code shown on your server's console
3. You now have full control from the cloud dashboard!

### Step 3: Install Your First Stack
1. In the dashboard, go to **App Store**
2. Click **Media Server** stack (Jellyfin + Radarr + Sonarr + Prowlarr + qBittorrent + Bazarr)
3. Click **Install Stack** — apps deploy into isolated containers automatically
4. Apps auto-wire themselves: Radarr connects to qBittorrent, Prowlarr syncs indexers to Radarr/Sonarr, etc.

### Step 4: Enjoy
- **Jellyfin**: Stream your movies and TV shows
- **Radarr**: Search and download movies automatically
- **Sonarr**: Search and download TV shows automatically
- Each app has its own IP, its own resources, and shows as a separate container in Proxmox
